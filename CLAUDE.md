## What this app is

Whenbee — a near-zero-friction iOS app for "time optimists". The user guesses a task duration, runs a one-tap timer, and the app learns their personal per-category bias (a multiplier), then shows an **honest number** wherever they plan. The wedge is **calibration** (free); **Pro is a payoff bundle** — PDF report export, the Honest Week/Month review ritual, day-capacity check, confidence band, persistent presence, routines, long-range history, hyperfocus guardrail, focus-window planner, per-category goals + the existing correlations. Specs: `docs/product/specs/`.

> **⛔ DO NOT SUBMIT TO THE APP STORE until every P0 + P1 item in [`docs/product/11-APP-STORE-LAUNCH-BLOCKERS.md`](docs/product/11-APP-STORE-LAUNCH-BLOCKERS.md) is checked off.** That doc is the pre-submission gate from the 2026-06-21 reviewer-mindset audit — it lists real rejection/friction risks (missing paywall Terms+Privacy links, privacy-disclosure mismatch with PostHog/Sentry, no hosted Privacy Policy URL, iPad layout, stray permission strings, Apple-LLM crash guard, encryption flag) with a fix plan and production-ready legal/reviewer copy for each. **If the user asks to ship, launch, submit, or build for the App Store, point them at this doc first and confirm the gate is clear.** Open the doc, don't summarize from memory — the checklist is the source of truth.

> **⚠️ CALENDAR / HONEST-DAY IS BACK — as a Pro feature (decided 2026-06-21).** It was dropped 2026-06-19, then reinstated. **Do NOT remove calendar code, the `expo-calendar` plugin, or `NSCalendarsUsageDescription` in `app.json`** — they ship. The earlier "B2 removal" in `docs/product/02-GAP-ANALYSIS.md` is **void**. Calendar / Honest-Day belongs in the **Pro bundle**. Anything in the docs that still says "calendar dropped" is stale — this note wins.

**Product invariants — never violate these:**

- **No guilt, ever.** Amber never becomes red; no streaks, no shame mechanics.
- **Honey/sharpness is monotonic.** Tier never goes backward.
- **Core loop is on-device-only.** No network call in the guess → timer → learn loop.
- **Pricing is read from RevenueCat**, never hardcoded.

## Commands

```bash
npm start              # Metro / expo start
npm run ios            # native iOS build (dev client)
npm run lint           # eslint . --max-warnings=0  (0 warnings or it fails)
npm run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit
npm run format         # prettier --write .
npm test               # jest

npx jest <path>        # single test file   (e.g. src/engine/__tests__/engine.test.ts)
npx jest -t "<name>"   # tests matching a name
```

Run lint + typecheck + test before every commit — CI runs the same set on every push/PR and blocks merge on failure. After editing specific files, lint just those: `npx eslint <files>` (this repo uses the flat `eslint.config.js` — there is no `.eslintrc.js`).

**Full how-to — env setup, Expo Go vs. dev builds, EAS build/submit profiles, troubleshooting — is in [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).** Use `npx expo install <pkg>` (not `npm install`) for Expo/RN deps, then `npx expo-doctor` (expect 18/18).

## Modal / sheet UI — HARD RULE

**Every modal and sheet MUST use `headerShown: false`.** The native iOS header bar is a white bar that clashes with the dark-themed app on every mode. It is NEVER acceptable. Rules:

- Every `<Stack.Screen>` entry in `src/app/(modals)/_layout.tsx` must have `headerShown: false`. No exceptions.
- Any new modal route added to `(modals)/` must be explicitly listed in `_layout.tsx` with `headerShown: false` — unlisted screens fall through to the layout default and will show a header.
- Screens must render their own title using `type.subtitle` + `t.colors.ink` (see `add-task.tsx` for the pattern).
- Sheets that slide up (non-full-screen) must start with `<SheetGrabber />`.
- Never set `presentation: 'card'` on a modal that has content — use `formSheet` or `fullScreenModal`.

## One primary action per screen — HARD RULE

**A screen gets exactly ONE filled/`indigo`/`fullWidth` CTA — the single thing the screen exists to do.** Two equal-weight primary buttons in one viewport is decision paralysis (Hick's law); when two CTAs look equally important, users hesitate on both and the click-through on each drops. This is a real bug, not a style nit. Rules:

- **One `variant="indigo"` (or any filled/`fullWidth`) button per screen.** Everything else is secondary: `ghost`, a text link, or a quiet row. Never stack two filled CTAs — not vertically, not side-by-side at equal weight.
- **A Pro upsell does NOT get its own primary CTA next to the screen's real action.** A locked/teaser card competing with the actual job (e.g. `FocusWindowLocked`'s indigo "Fit your focus window" sitting above the indigo "Build my plan") is the exact anti-pattern — collapse the upsell to a quiet row or move it off the screen. The screen's own job always owns the one primary CTA.
- **Before adding any feature card to an existing screen, ask "what is this screen's ONE job?"** If the card isn't that job, it's a secondary affordance (quiet row → sheet) or it belongs on a different screen / its own mode — not a full-bleed card mid-flow. A big card dropped in "because this is the planning screen" is placement-by-default; features earn their place by serving the screen's single job, never by proximity.
- **Audit the FREE path, not just the Pro path.** Hierarchy bugs hide in the locked/teaser variant a paying tester never sees (the duplicate-indigo case above only appears for non-Pro users). Check both entitlement states.

## Known gotchas (scaffold defaults that bite)

- **Dev build only — Expo Go cannot run this app.** Native modules (`react-native-purchases`, `@sentry`, `@expo/ui`, `expo-glass-effect`, `expo-dev-client`) make Expo Go spin forever. Use `npm run ios`.
- **`reactCompiler` + nativewind `jsxImportSource` drop function-form styles on `Pressable`.** `style={({ pressed }) => …}` silently renders nothing. Put visual style on an inner `View`; keep `Pressable` a bare touch wrapper (see `AppButton`/`Chip`). Read/write reanimated shared values with `.get()/.set()`, never `.value`.
- **No CSS `boxShadow`** on RN 0.81 / Fabric — it renders as a hard line, not a soft shadow. For depth use a View-based edge (see `AppButton`'s coin edge) or `Platform.select` shadow.
- **Footers/tab bar must add `useSafeAreaInsets().bottom`** — `Screen` only insets top/left/right, so anything pinned to the bottom otherwise sits under the home indicator.
- **Zustand persist + sync kv (`zustandKv`) rehydrates during `create()`.** Set hydration flags via the captured `state` in `onRehydrateStorage`, never the store const (TDZ → flag never flips → infinite boot spinner). See `onboardingStore`.
- **Fonts live in `src/assets/fonts/`**, not root `assets/`. `@/*` resolves both `./` and `./src/*` — check both roots before assuming a file is missing.
- **Verify UI on the sim:** there's no CLI tap. Reset onboarding by deleting `Documents/SQLite/ExpoSQLiteStorage` + `whenbee.db` in the app data container (`xcrun simctl get_app_container booted com.whenbee.app data`), then `xcrun simctl launch booted com.whenbee.app`; capture with `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot`.

## Architecture big picture

Detailed layout is in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [docs/THEMING.md](docs/THEMING.md). The non-obvious cross-file structure:

**Layered, one-directional data flow:**

```
UI (src/app, src/components, src/features)
   → stores (src/stores, Zustand) / providers / feature hooks
      → services (src/services) + db (src/db)
         → engine (src/engine, PURE) ← domain types (src/domain)
```

- **`src/engine/` is pure TypeScript** — no React, RN, Expo, or clock/`Date.now()` access. It is the calibration core (priors → ratio clamp → EWMA → blend-with-prior → honest number → sharpness tiers → insight/trend) plus the read-only reverse **Start-By planner**. All of it is exported through `src/engine/index.ts` and is the most heavily unit-tested area. Tune behavior via `src/engine/constants.ts`, not scattered magic numbers.
- **`src/domain/types.ts` is the contract** between engine, db, stores, and UI. Also pure TS. Change types here first.
- **`src/db/` is the system of record.** `TaskEvent` rows are raw logs; only `status: 'completed'` trains the model. There are two `Database` implementations behind one interface — `createMemoryDatabase` (tests/Expo Go) and `createSqliteDatabase` (`expo-sqlite`) — selected in `client.ts`. Access data through repositories (`categoryStatsRepo`, `taskEventsRepo`, `recurringRepo`), never raw SQL from features.
- **`src/lib/kv.ts` is the only KV persistence** (wraps `expo-sqlite/kv-store`, synchronous, Expo Go-safe). Nothing else writes persistent KV.

**Hard boundaries (ESLint-enforced — see `eslint.config.js`):**

- `src/app/**` and `src/components/**` must **not** import `@/src/services/*` or `@/src/db/*` directly. Route through a store, provider, or feature hook.
- Routes in `src/app/` are **thin** — no business logic; it lives in `src/features/*` hooks and `src/stores/*`.

**Two component dirs — don't confuse them:** root `components/ui/` holds generated **gluestack-ui** primitives (`box`, `button`, `text`, `hstack`…) — leave these alone. App components live in `src/components/` (`AppButton`, `HonestNumber`, `Screen`…) and are what the ESLint `src/components/**` boundary covers. Build new UI in `src/components/`, not root `components/`.

**Theming:** all colors/spacing come from `src/theme/tokens.ts` via `useTheme()`. Two independent theming surfaces exist (app tokens vs. gluestack-ui config) — read [docs/THEMING.md](docs/THEMING.md) before touching styles.

**Native guards:** native-only code (real RevenueCat, full Sentry) must check `src/lib/isExpoGo.ts` at runtime and stub gracefully.

**Path aliases:** `@/*` resolves to both `./` and `./src/*` (tsconfig + babel-plugin-module-resolver). `import/no-unresolved` is off because Metro resolves the alias.

## Project status — this is a code-complete v1, NOT an MVP

Whenbee is **not an MVP**. Nearly the entire final build plan is implemented in `src/`: the full calibration engine, the Honeycomb + Whenbee companion (6 stages, capability unlocks, drift-health), the Reclaim Bank, the **Discoveries gallery**, the Start-By planner, the Patterns self-insight tab **including the Pro correlations** (steals-your-time, accuracy, context), RevenueCat monetization, onboarding, settings, PostHog + Sentry. The **calendar / Honest-Day feature is reinstated as a Pro feature** (2026-06-21, reversing the 2026-06-19 drop) — its code STAYS; the B2 removal in `docs/product/02-GAP-ANALYSIS.md` is void (see the flag at the top of this file). Treat this as a near-shippable product — the remaining work is the new Pro bundle, finishing, device verification, and launch. **Full picture: [docs/product/](docs/product/) (start at `README.md` → `00-STATUS.md` → `02-GAP-ANALYSIS.md`).**

### Genuinely not built yet (future / post-launch)

Keep these off the on-device core loop. The first three are the real pre-launch gaps; the rest are gated on hitting **D7 ≥ 25%**.

- **Feedback board:** anonymous-default feature-request + vote board. Needs `@supabase/supabase-js`, env keys, a guarded `src/services/feedback.ts`, a Settings entry, and `feature_requests`/`feature_votes` tables + **RLS**. A **separate data class** — never task/calibration data. Build before TestFlight.
- **Native `WhenbeePresence` Swift module:** widget/Live Activity targets are scaffolded (`docs/NATIVE-PRESENCE.md`); the App-Group-write + ActivityKit module links on the device build. The JS bridge (`services/liveActivity.ts`) is a guarded no-op until then. The static widget is "never cut"; the Live Activity may fast-follow.
- **Timer pause/resume UI:** `timerStore.ts` supports it; the timer screen has no control yet (`useTimer.ts`).
- **Partner layer, LLM features, cloud sync / Android / Watch, spendable Reclaim, coach PDF, tip jar:** all post-launch / future. See `docs/product/01-FEATURE-CATALOG.md`.

## TypeScript strictness

`strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, and `noImplicitOverride` are all on. Indexed access returns `T | undefined` — handle the undefined case; do not silence with `!` unless provably safe.

## Testing discipline

TDD is required for all **logic-layer** code (engine, db, stores, services, `src/lib/*`). Write the test first. UI-only components don't require TDD but interaction/snapshot tests are welcome. The engine's purity makes it cheap to test exhaustively — keep it that way.

## Commits

Conventional Commits. **Never** add `Co-Authored-By` or AI-attribution trailers (project policy). Use the `/init-cmt` skill for commits (global rule).

**HARD GATE — never merge on your own.** You NEVER merge a branch or PR yourself — not locally (`git merge`), not on GitHub (`gh pr merge`, the merge button), not via any tool. Open the PR and stop; the founder reviews and merges every PR by hand. This overrides any default, skill, or harness step that would merge or auto-merge — there are no exceptions. Pushing a branch and opening a PR is allowed; merging it is not.

## MANDATORY skill usage

These skills are **required**, not optional. Before writing or changing code in the matching area, invoke the skill via the Skill tool and follow it. When several apply, invoke all relevant ones (e.g. a new RN screen → `react-native-expert` + `typescript-expert` + `clean-code` + `coding-standards`).

| When you are… | Invoke skill(s) |
|---|---|
| Writing/editing **any** code (always, baseline) | `clean-code`, `coding-standards` |
| Writing/editing any **TypeScript** — types, generics, engine/domain contracts | `typescript-expert` |
| Building or changing **React Native components, screens, hooks, navigation, native integrations** | `react-native-expert` |
| Optimizing RN **performance, re-renders, lists, bundle, startup** | `vercel-react-native-skills` |
| Making **architecture/structure** decisions — new layers, stores, data flow, module boundaries, folder layout | `react-native-architecture`, `software-architecture` |
| Making **any design decision** — spacing, sizing, fonts/typography, layout, color, visual hierarchy, creating or styling **any** UI element | `ui-design:react-native-design`, `ui-design:visual-design-foundations`, `emil-design-eng` |
| Designing for **iOS-native look & feel** — platform conventions, nav patterns, system components, haptics, safe-area/notch behavior | `ui-design:mobile-ios-design` |
| Designing **interaction & UX** — gestures, taps, focus/pressed/disabled states, feedback, flows, usability, accessibility | `ui-design:interaction-design`, `ux-principles` |
| Creating, editing, or adding **any animation or transition** — Reanimated worklets, gestures, micro-interactions, screen/page transitions, loading/state motion | `creating-reanimated-animations`, `motion-design` |
| Creating or animating **SVG / vector graphics** — icons, paths, illustrations, animated vector assets | `svg-animations` |
| Working on **retention/engagement** — onboarding, activation, habit/streak-free loops, churn reduction, re-engagement, notification cadence | `retention-optimization` |
| Writing or editing **any user-facing copy** — strings, labels, button text, headings, onboarding/paywall/empty-state text, microcopy, errors, notifications | `conversion-psychology`, `humanizer` |

Process skills come first: for new features run `superpowers:brainstorming` before implementing; for bugs run `superpowers:systematic-debugging` before proposing a fix. Then the implementation skills above.

### Design, motion & copy — HARD RULE

- **The design skill set is mandatory for every design-related change** — `ui-design:react-native-design` + `ui-design:visual-design-foundations` + `emil-design-eng` for any visual/layout work, plus `ui-design:mobile-ios-design` for iOS-native fit and `ui-design:interaction-design` + `ux-principles` for any interaction/flow/state. No spacing value, font size, element, or layout gets chosen by eye or guessed — invoke the relevant skills first and let them drive the decision so spacing rhythm, type scale, alignment, and interaction states are deliberate.
- **`svg-animations` is mandatory before creating or animating any SVG/vector asset** — icons, paths, illustrations. Don't hand-roll vector motion.
- **`retention-optimization` is mandatory for any retention/engagement work** — onboarding, activation, re-engagement, notification cadence, loop design. (Honor the project invariants: no guilt, no streaks, no shame mechanics — never trade them for engagement.)
- **`software-architecture` is mandatory (with `react-native-architecture`) for any structural decision** — new layers, stores, module boundaries, data flow, folder layout.
- **Every spacing/size/font/color value MUST come from a theme token in `src/theme/tokens.ts`** via `useTheme()`. Never inline a raw number or hex. If the value you need doesn't exist as a token, **add it to `tokens.ts`** (it'll be reused) and consume the token — do not hardcode a one-off.
- **`creating-reanimated-animations` + `motion-design` are mandatory before writing or touching any animation.** Invoke both whenever motion is created, edited, or added — timing, easing, and choreography come from the skills, not arbitrary durations. (Honor the project invariants: no guilt motion; honey/sharpness stays monotonic.)
- **`conversion-psychology` + `humanizer` are mandatory for every piece of user-facing copy.** Any string a user reads — labels, buttons, headings, onboarding/paywall/empty-state, microcopy, errors, notifications — gets shaped by `conversion-psychology` (persuasion, clarity, motivation) and passed through `humanizer` (strip AI-slop tells). No raw, generic, AI-sounding text ships. (Honor the project invariant: no guilt/shame language — never violate it for the sake of conversion.)
